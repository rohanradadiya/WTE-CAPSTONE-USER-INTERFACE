# WTE CAPSTONE USER INTERFACE - Rohan

 - This repository contains the project files for the user interface for the Capstone Project - Design and Implementation of an Integrated Data-Driven Waste Management System
 - This project folder is meant to represent and be used for simulation purposes, the user interface for the real-time sensor data collection is separate.
 - This user interface contains various dashboards for the different stakeholders at play for this Capstone project, such as the Homeowner, Truck Drivers, Municipality Workers, etc.
 - There is also a Google Map embedded with an API credential as well, but to utilize that after downloading the project source code, the user would need to generate a Google Maps API credential first and input it in the "MapComponent.js" file for the "googleMapsApiKey" variable.
 - All of the data in this user interface is simulated and embedded into the code, as a separate user interface contains the functionality of real-time sensor data collection and database.
